This is the program I used for testing during my internship at the Naval Research Laboratory. I used and modified open-source programs to accomplish goals relating to the recognition of US license plates. These goals include recognizing whether an image contained a license plate, outlining the license plate in a still image, returning the license plate number, determining orientation and distance of a plate in a still image, and testing these objectives in noisy images to simulate low-light and foggy conditions.
