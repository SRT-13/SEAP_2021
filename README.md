This is the program I used for testing during my internship at the Naval Research Laboratory. I used and modified open-source programs to accomplish goals relating to the recognition of US license plates. These goals include recognizing whether an image contained a license plate, outlining the license plate in a still image, returning the license plate number, determining orientation and distance of a plate in a still image, and testing these objectives in noisy images to simulate low-light and foggy conditions.

The initial open-source program I modified was created by Quang Nguyen and can be found here: https://medium.com/@quangnhatnguyenle/detect-and-recognize-vehicles-license-plate-with-machine-learning-and-python-part-1-detection-795fda47e922
